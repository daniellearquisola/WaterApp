# Water-Mon
_Water-Mon is a mobile application that helps to track daily water intake._


## How to Use Water-Mon
After opening Water-Mon, a user can go to the counter page. Every time they drink a glass of water, they can press on the water symbol. If they need to remove a glass, they can press on the leaf symbol. (It's a leaf because in pokemon, water is weak against grass type).
After the page originally renders, the user will see an egg. After one glass of water, the egg will hatch into a squirtle. By drinking more glasses of water, the pokemon will either remain happy or evolve. Squirtle will evolve twice, once into Wartortle, and lastly into Blastoise. 

## About this project
Water-Mon was made during a weekend "stack-a-thon" at fullstack academy by Danielle Arquisola and Bryan Ryu. We had three days to explore a new tool/library that they were unfamiliar with. We chose to look into React Native. We both had had zero experiene with any type of mobile development prior to this project.
This project has limitations. It is not currently connected to a database, and there is hard coded information within the components. Although we were unable to complete a fully functional most viable product, we were able to learn about how to use React Native and Expo.


## Getting Started

Water-Mon is currently in a view-mode only state, with no backend functionality. However, you can still clone this repo to your local machine. 

Install dependencies for the project with

```
npm install
```

Although Water-Mon is not deployed, it can be seen using Expo. Run expo using 

```
expo start
```

Once that is running, you can either open up the app using a simulator on your machine, or on your mobile device. To view the app on your mobile device, download the app Expo Client. You can then scan the QR code to view it on your phone.
